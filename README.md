# 🏦 Bank Data Warehouse

This repo is where we’ve created the foundational setup of a data warehouse that’s meant to work for a typical banking environment. It’s built to help make sense of data coming from different banking systems whether it’s transactions, UPI activity, customer info, or merchant operations.

The idea is to bring all of that into one place, shape it in a way that makes reporting and analytics easier, and do it in a way that works whether the bank is running on the cloud or on-prem.

It’s structured to be modular, so teams can plug in new sources or scale things out when needed. And while we’ve built this to meet compliance and reporting needs, the goal was to make it something clean and reliable something that other teams could actually reuse or build on without starting from scratch.
